# Software Test Automation & QA Portfolio for CS 320

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure resides in utilizing tools that allow for testing of said code. In the case of this course, using JUnit for unit testing in Java was an efficient way to secure my code and to ensure each test passed when ran. Having proper requirements and proper code quality also ensures functionality in that while going through the code, it would be readable and prepared for testing.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

Interpreting user needs into a program is a vital part of the development and the overall software development lifecycle. Throughout this course, I focused on understanding the requirements given for each assignment, and how to properly apply this within my code, especially during the JUnit testing process. Incorporating user needs into a program boils down to understanding the userâ€™s specific requirements and ensuring as the programmer I interpret them accordingly. 

**How do I approach designing software?**

Designing software is another important aspect of the software development lifecycle and is an important part of development as a whole. In my case, I approach designing my software by using techniques I have learned, especially by utilizing techniques like pseudocode and flowcharts (such as UML diagrams). These techniques and tools have helped me greatly in understanding how to break down the requirements given for a user, and also how it should look once the software is complete.
